## How to get the SERVER running:
1. Open a terminal window inside the [`server/`](/server/) directory.
2. Run `npm i` to download all dependencies (might take a while).
3. Run `npm run start` to start the server!

To change the environment variables, such as MongoDB server URL, edit the
[.env](/.env) file at the root of this project.

## How to get the CLIENT running:
1. Open a terminal window inside the [`client/`](/client/) directory.
2. Run `npm i` to download all dependencies (might take a while).
3. Run `npm run start` to start the client!

To change the client-side global variables, such as the API endpoint URL, edit
the [globalConstants.ts](client/src/globalConstants.ts) file located in
[client/src/](client/src/).
