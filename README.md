## How to get the SERVER running:
1. Open a terminal window inside the [`server/`](/server/) directory.
2. Run `npm i` to download all dependencies (might take a while).
3. Run `npm run start` to start the server!

To change the environment variables, such as MongoDB server URL, edit the
[.env](/.env) file at the root of this project.
